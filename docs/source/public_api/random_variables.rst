probnum.random_variables
========================

Random Variables.

Random variables generalize multi-dimensional arrays by also encoding uncertainty
about the (numerical) quantity in question. Despite their name, they do not
necessarily represent stochastic objects. Random variables are also the primary in-
and outputs of probabilistic numerical methods.
