# Roundtable on Probabilistic Numerics (2014)

**Tübingen, Germany, 21 - 22 August 2014**

The roundtable was organised by Philipp Hennig (MPI Tübingen) and Michael
Osborne (Oxford). Mark Girolami (UCL / Warwick) presented an invited talk.

The roundtable took place from the morning of 21 August to the early afternoon
of 22 August. Hosted by the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in
Tübingen, Germany, it provided an informal setting for everyone interested in
the development of probabilistic numerical methods. The roundtable was neither
a workshop nor a conference. There are no proceedings, and attendees did not
have to submit a paper to attend. Apart from a small number of talks, the
schedule focused strongly on small-group discussions on specific aspects. Some
of the questions discussed in 2014 included

* What is a well-defined notion of "uncertainty" for a probabilistic numerical
  method? What are the limits of error estimation?

* What are good data-structures for the communication between numerical methods
  in a pipeline? How can numerical methods convey requirements for precision
  among each other?

* To which degree should numerical methods be inspired by existing numerical
  frameworks, and where should we deviate from established concepts? Is there a
  place for ab initio probabilistic solutions to existing numerical problems?

* In building probabilistic methods, when are richer models worth their
  associated computational cost? Can we develop families of numerical methods
  with cost/accuracy trade-offs tunable to the requirements of the problem at
  hand?

* Can we support new probabilistic numerical methods with the theory required
  for them to find broad acceptance?


Forming a community
-------------------

Over the past years, a number of researchers stemming largely from the areas of
machine learning and statistics have attempted to build such probabilistic
numerical methods. A first meeting point for this group was the 2013 NIPS
Workshop on Probabilistic Numerics. Probabilistic Numerics is still a fledgling
community, in fact many of us do not know each other well, and we do not always
know of each other's work. The Probabilistic Numerics Roundtable hopes to
alleviate this problem.
