  abstract =	 {Contemporary global optimization algorithms are based on
                  local measures of utility, rather than a probability measure
                  over location and value of the optimum. They thus attempt to
                  collect low function values, not to learn about the
                  optimum. The reason for the absence of probabilistic global
                  optimizers is that the corresponding inference problem is
                  intractable in several ways. This paper develops desiderata
                  for probabilistic optimization algorithms, then presents a
                  concrete algorithm which addresses each of the computational
                  intractabilities with a sequence of approximations and
                  explicitly adresses the decision problem of maximizing
                  information gain from each evaluation. },
