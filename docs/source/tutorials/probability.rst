Probability
===========

Random variables are the main objects in ProbNum. They represent uncertainty about a numerical quantity in their distribution. A probabilistic numerical method takes random variables as inputs and also outputs random variables. 

See the notebooks below to learn more about how to use and manipulate probabilistic quantities in ProbNum.
